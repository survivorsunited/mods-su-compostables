# Usage Guide

Learn how to use the Compostables mod effectively in your Minecraft world.

## Getting Started

### Basic Composting

1. **Craft or find a composter** - Standard Minecraft recipe
2. **Right-click with compostable items** - Including all the new ones!
3. **Collect bone meal** - When composter reaches level 7

### Tips for Efficient Composting

- **Set up collection systems** - Hoppers work great for automation
- **Use high-chance items** - Cooked meats give 85% chance
- **Don't waste valuable items** - Raw meat might be better used for food
- **Farm rotten flesh** - Now it's useful at 50% chance!

## Automation Ideas

### Rotten Flesh Farm
Turn your zombie spawner into a bone meal factory:
1. Funnel zombie drops into hoppers
2. Connect hoppers to composters
3. Collect bone meal below

### Meat Processing
1. Raw meat → Cook in furnace → 85% compost chance
2. More efficient than composting raw (65%)

### Egg Farm Integration
- Chicken farms now produce compostable eggs
- Automated collection straight to composters

## Best Practices

### Early Game
- Compost rotten flesh from zombie encounters
- Use dead bushes found in deserts
- Dirt paths from villages are compostable

### Mid Game
- Set up automated farms with hoppers
- Cook meat before composting for better rates
- Farm chorus fruits in the End

### Late Game
- Industrial-scale composting arrays
- Villager-powered composting systems
- Multi-source organic waste processing

## Villager Interactions

Farmer villagers will now:
- Pick up dropped compostable items
- Use them in nearby composters
- Help maintain your composting area

**Pro tip**: Create a villager composting area with multiple composters for passive bone meal generation!
